# breakooutOpenGL

That is my copy of breakout based on learnopengl of [JoeyDeVries](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL). You can see the original source on his repo or use the complete tutorial on his [site](https://learnopengl.com/). It was copied only for educational purpose.

# Building the project
My way of building the project is more like [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) way of doing things using MSVC and batchfiles. So for now I don't have neither Makefile nor cmake to build the project in a more simple maner.
